## Welcome to travel destination keeper!

It is a simple app that allows you to search for places and add them to your "to visit" list. Feel free to move around and explore! You can move between places by selecting a place on the list.

This app is a product of my recent skill boosting excercise in React that I planned for myself as an effective way to learn building web apps. I took the approach of learning by doing and decided not to use any tutorials or ready node packages for google maps components. Just docs and stackoverflow.

The app uses **Google Maps Javascript API** as a provider for map, autocomplete and marker functionalities. It is developed using pure React. Decision to not use redux was aimed to enforce a strong design of parent/children strategy, plan data flow and distribute state adequately.

It is available on: https://filswa.github.io/travel-destination-keeper/

Possible plans for future include:
- refactor using redux
- refactor using hooks
- refactor using React Context API
- add storing user data in local storage
- add tests using jest
